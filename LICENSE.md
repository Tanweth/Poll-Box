I will provide reasonable support when I can, but the usual applies about warranties. No warranty is provided if this module somehow destoys your computer, eradicates your website, renders your life destitute of happiness, or causes other annoyances. That said, if any of the above scenarios happens, you may want to let me know, as none of them are intended functionality.
